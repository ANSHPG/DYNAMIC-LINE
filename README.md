# DYNAMIC-LINE
🔍 What's Inside:
In this repository, you'll find the code and assets that power a captivating animation. When you hover over the selected div or element, a sleek line elegantly emerges with a gradual increase in width. The magic happens as the line gracefully retracts upon mouse leave, moving towards the right direction. 🎯

💡 How It Works:
By leveraging the capabilities of GSAP, I've created a seamless animation that enhances user interaction and user experience. The precision of timing and easing functions brings a professional touch to the design, making it stand out.

🎨 Why It Matters:
Animations like these are not just visually appealing; they also contribute to a richer user experience and can be a valuable addition to your web projects. This example showcases how small details can make a big impact.
